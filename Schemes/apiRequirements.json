Deviation from the Information Security policy implemented by the CSP is discouraged. However, exception may be considered if a presentation of a reasonable and justifiable reason is provided. The expression, &ldquo;there is an exception to every rule&rdquo; is also true in information security policies context. There are often legitimate reasons why an exception to a policy is needed. In these cases, the policy should define how approval for the exception to the policy is obtained, and management should be aware of exceptions to security policies as the exception to the policy could introduce risks that need to be mitigated in another way.</p><p>In the context of EUCS requirements exceptions can have organizational or technical causes, such as:</p><ul><li>An organizational unit deviating from the intended processes and procedures in order to meet the requirements of a cloud customer.</li><li>A system component lacking technical properties to be configured according to the applicable requirements.</li></ul><p>Cloud customers can use appropriate controls to ensure that they obtain information from the Cloud Service Provider about deviations from information security policies and instructions in order to assess and appropriately manage the associated risks to their own information security.</p><p>While at basic assurance level, maintaining a list of exceptions is sufficient, at substantial level, those exceptions are required to be approved and taken into account by the risk management. Therefore, the exceptions need to be collected and approved, as part of the risk management process. A complete description of the exception shall be maintained including relevant information such as exception description, exception duration, compensating controls for managing the risk associated with the exception, proposed review date, or others. The approvals of exceptions may be documented, limited in time and reviewed for appropriateness at least annually by the risk owners.</p><p>At the high assurance level, the list of the exception must also be automatically monitored. The continuous monitoring of the exceptions list should be automated to ensure that they do not exceed their &ldquo;lifespan&rdquo; in the system and that exceptions do not remain active after approval has been revoked. Such a monitoring tool should be capable of issuing notifications and regular status updates when an exception expires, has been approved or has been revoked by the risk owner. This could be achieved through languages similar to the one defined in the OSCAL (Open Security Controls Assessment Language).</p>",

Specifically, accounts that are inactive for a long period of time or that are subject to suspicious activity are appropriately protected to reduce opportunities for abuse<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>.</p><p>Locking an account implies that the user is denied access temporarily from the account, the privileges and access rights associated to the account are not modified, the user needs to follow a procedure involving an administrator or system component in order to get the account unlocked. Revoking an account is a stronger measure, which implies that the user is denied access from the account, the privileges and access rights associated to the account are revoked, and it may be possible to re-create an account with the same identifier, but the access rights then must be provisioned again to the account, following the normal procedure.</p><p>Hence, to be compliant with IAM-03 first it is important to set up a period of time in which it is allowed for an account to be inactive. Passed that time, the account shall be disabled, or an alert shall be sent to the user for an action to be taken in compliance with the policy and procedures defined under the ISP category. Secondly, the automated monitoring tool to be set up must verify that this alert was sent or that the disabling occurred on the interval of time specified. For this, the logs of the events produced by the automated mechanisms could be monitored.</p><p>All accounts should be automatically monitored to ensure that any account that has been inactive for more than the maximum period of inactivity associated to that account is indeed locked, and that the maximum period of inactivity associated to the account does not exceed two months. After this maximum period of inactivity is reached, the user account should be locked, so the user should be denied any attempt to authenticate. Typically, if a user attempts to connect to a locked account, they should be warned of the status of the account. Deviations should be detected and signalled to authorized personnel (e.g., administrator).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v2-identity-management#im-2-manage-application-identities-securely-and-automatically\"><sup>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v2-identity-management#im-2-manage-application-identities-securely-and-automatically</sup></a></p>",

An example of such is &ldquo;geolocation&rdquo; where a user whose IP at last login shows s/he is logging in from Europe should not have an IP from East Asia when s/he attempts to login again two hours later.</p><p>In this requirement, the strength of the authentication mechanisms is very important as it builds on top of the authentication mechanisms strength of the previous IAM-03 control requirements. This includes among other aspects the protection level of the passwords, the use of a centrally managed authentication method, and so on.</p><p>Having strong authentication methods can reduce significantly suspicious events. However, other practices should be put in practice such as single sign on, multi-factor authentication, multi-factor authentication with conditional access policy, role-based access control (RBAC), to name a few.</p><p>The automated monitoring of authentication attempts should consider at least the following aspects:</p><ul><li>Number of authentication attempts, which can be seen in the logs.</li><li>Sign-ins of users, that is, who has logged in into the service and how the service and resources have been used. This can be seen by monitoring the logs.</li><li>Suspicious sign-in such as brute-force attacks, leaked credentials, unfamiliar locations, time schedule or devices. This can be seen by analysing the logs.</li><li>Enable alerts for these suspicious activities so that the customer is informed.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h5>&nbsp;</h5>",

Part of the system hardening elimination process involves deleting or disabling needless system applications, permissions, ports, user accounts, and other features. This will allow to reduce attackers&rsquo; opportunities to gain access to a mission-critical or critical-infrastructure system&rsquo;s sensitive information. The hardening process should then be updated to include new patches or software versions in the baseline configuration, so that the next time similar systems are deployed, old vulnerabilities are not re-introduced into environments.</p><p>To fulfil OPS-21.1H, first, a set of hardening specifications (and assets that should be hardened) needs to be defined and documented. The CSP then needs to monitor the fulfilment according to these specifications. The verification of compliance with the specifications for the hardening of system components can be automatically tested and subsequently documented (logs). For instance, a set of hardened virtual machine images may be defined, and then it can be monitored if the deployed images comply with this set. Further hardening specifications may target the existence of components with known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and open ports. If the CSP is using non-modifiable images, the hardening process should be done during the creation of those images. Configuration and log files regarding the continuous availability of the images should be retained.</p><p>Service components can be monitored as part of their secure development lifecycle. Regular checks should run on source repositories of service components. Scans should check for old and vulnerable software dependencies. In addition, regularly executed validation can ensure that newly identified vulnerabilities are discovered quickly.</p><p>Compliance with hardening specifications can be monitored with e.g., file integrity monitoring. The verification of compliance with the specifications for the hardening of system components can be automatically tested and subsequently documented (logs). The auditor can evaluate these logs automatically and continuously and thus carry out a continuous audit.</p>",

This could be done through usual interfaces used internally for monitoring or specific interfaces put in place specifically for customers. These provided accesses should be implemented in compliance with the IAM-09 requirements.</p><p>Native cloud backup services offered by most CSPs (e.g., Azure backup<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a> or AWS backup<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a> will offer out of the box the &ldquo;portal&rdquo; or API functionalities which implement data backup and recovery services (with exception of the organizational parts from these requirements). Continuous monitoring in this case implies assessing if those services are being deployed by the cloud customer, although the obvious limitation of this approach is that it does not guarantee that the actual configuration has been performed (e.g., data retention times).</p><p>Continuous monitoring of the data backup service offered by the CSP will assess the existence of technical configuration properties like those mentioned on OPS-06.1H, which have to do with retention time, backup frequency, RTO/RPO, encryption, and role management. It can be expected that these technical configuration properties can be assessed directly from the data backup service&rsquo;s configuration offered by the CSP<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]</a>. However, it must be noticed that automated assessment can be limited (out of the box) to the data backup services native to the CSP, but not to 3<sup>rd</sup> party services which are deployed by the cloud customer.</p><p>Also, to be noticed is the referenced OPS-08 (recovery procedures), which mostly consists in organizational requirements (e.g., OPS-08.3H), which cannot be expected to be automatically monitored at the state of practice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-center-overview\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-center-overview</a></p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\">[2]</a> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/?id=docs_gateway\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/?id=docs_gateway</a></p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\">[3]</a> As an example, Azure Policies in the case of Azure backup (<a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-center-overview\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-center-overview</a>), or ConfigRules for AWS backup (<a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/?id=docs_gateway\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/?id=docs_gateway</a>)</p>",

The data is usually stored in a way that allows centralized evaluation, and can contain sensitive private information or information about the system and cloud service functioning such that a breach or unauthorized access is highly undesirable. In addition, storage space is finite, and the longer logs are stored, the greater the security risk to the environment. Thus, once logs have been used for their intended purpose or their legally required storage duration is passed, they should be immediately and safely deleted from the system.</p><p>Cloud providers like Azure offer managed logging services. In such services, e.g., Azure activity logs, a CSP can simply configure the retention time and monitor its correct settings to fulfil the requirement. For self-created logs, the agents or framework need to provide a way of checking the retention time. Alternatively, the storage that holds the logs needs to be monitored regarding its retention time / deletion mechanisms.</p><p>To fulfil this requirement, the CSP should automatically monitor the effectiveness of the respective logging and monitoring mechanisms as well as incorporate changes in the monitoring configuration based on applicable policies. The CSP should put in place mechanisms to monitor the consolidation process resulting from the aggregation of logging data from various origins, and to keep track of deletion of the logs.</p>",

Although the configuration of the service is in constant change, it cannot be deployed without being approved in order the minimize the risks of failure upon implementation. These modifications to the architecture configuration are often very frequent, so it is advisable to automatically monitor the approvals of these changes deployed in the production environment to ensure they are done before they are made available to CSCs in the production environment. The CSP&rsquo;s approval may be provided by authorized personnel of the CSP or by an automated procedure enforcing defined criteria.</p><p>When changes impact CSC&rsquo;s services, the CSP should make sure to involve the CSCs in the approval processes in accordance with the contractual agreements and before changes are made available in the production environment. In these situations, the cloud customers can ensure through suitable controls that authorized and qualified personnel receive the information made available, assesses the impact on the ISMS framework and decides on the approval in accordance with the conditions specified by the Cloud Service Provider. The CSCs involvement in approval process should be made available in the cloud customers guidance.</p><p>Tools can be used to provide the administrator with an overview of all the approvals<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a>. A checking process could be carried out to check actual results against estimates. If this process is successfully passed, an approval could be maintained. Verification that all tests have been completed, successful and approved by an authorized body can be automated by the Cloud Service Provider and documented through logs, which can then be automatically and continuously evaluated by the auditor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> <a href=\"https://www.suse.com/suse-defines/definition/production-environment/\">https://www.suse.com/suse-defines/definition/production-environment/</a></p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\">[2]</a> <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/approvals?view=azure-devops&amp;tabs=check-pass\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/approvals?view=azure-devops&amp;tabs=check-pass</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

Every time a change is introduced in the information security policies, procedures and practices, the same form should be digitally signed again to make sure that all employees are aware of the changes.

While the automatic monitoring of transporting backups via backup media, like physical disks, is usually not possible, backups transmitted to remote locations can be monitored automatically. Moreover, since this media could be subject to theft for example, the backup data may be stored in a encrypted form in compliance with the state-of-the-art of CKM-02.</p><p>For example, cloud providers like Azure and AWS provide redundancy options which also include automatic backups to remote locations, e.g., different regions for Azure Storage Accounts. Depending on the cloud provider and the chosen tier, options include automatic redundancy within a certain region or zone, or replication across zones.</p><p>The monitoring of this requirement therefore may be conducted by checking if the configuration of geo-redundant backups in the respective storage services is active. If no such managed backup option is available, the monitoring may be performed by verifying the existence of the respective backup at the remote location.</p>",

OPS-18.6H moves the responsibility of providing a mechanism to automate patching by the CSP. It should be possible to distribute software updates to the affected users automatically (without human interaction) and to perform the updates only after explicit approval from the user, the approval should be recorded.</p><p>Cloud providers usually offer the possibility of enabling automatic patching for managed resources, like virtual machines. For example,&nbsp;Azure VMs can&nbsp;be patched automatically&nbsp;(or on&nbsp;demand)<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>. In this case, a monitoring can simply check whether the respective configuration is enabled.&nbsp;</p><p>It depends, however, on the resource type if such a mechanism is available, or if more effort by the CSP is&nbsp;needed.&nbsp;For&nbsp;example, language runtimes in Azure Web Apps may be updated automatically or&nbsp;have to&nbsp;be switched by the user<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a>.</p><p>Note that this requirement concerns assets provided&nbsp;to the&nbsp;CSCs and the approval from the CSC should be recorded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/automatic-vm-guest-patching\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/automatic-vm-guest-patching</a></p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\">[2]</a> <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-patch-os-runtime\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-patch-os-runtime</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div id=\"gtx-anchor\" style=\"position: absolute; visibility: hidden; left: 543.828px; top: 1088.88px; width: 6.73438px; height: 13px;\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"jfk-bubble gtx-bubble\" style=\"visibility: visible; left: 125px; top: 1112px; opacity: 1;\">&nbsp;</div>",

The assignment of tasks to roles will allow a separation of duties as part of the role management process. The role assignment is monitored by the CSP.</p><p>A defined team shall be defined that is responsible for overseeing the security and control environments at the organization. It will verify the roles of each member and validate that security and control environments are being reviewed and followed up upon. Managers will check with each member to review responsibilities and roles at least annually.</p><p>Roles and responsibilities of the users are defined and agreed on in a risk assessment performed by the CSP. The risk assessment should cover administrative and user rights, and should include definitions related to data ownership, information security accountability, access provisioning and approval responsibilities, development, testing and release of changes, data backup and recovery responsibilities, and operation of the system components. Some mitigation measures should be introduced to monitor the activities in order to detect unauthorised or unintended changes as well as misuse.</p><p>A risk assessment for administrative user rights should consider the potential risks associated with granting certain users the ability to modify or delete logs or log analysis of their actions. This could include risks such as:</p><ul><li>Tampering with logs to cover up malicious or inappropriate activity.</li><li>Accidentally or intentionally deleting important logs that may be needed for later analysis or investigation.</li><li>Disrupting the integrity and reliability of log data, which could hinder incident response and forensics efforts.</li></ul><p>To mitigate these risks, it is important to carefully consider which users should be granted administrative rights and to establish strict policies and procedures for the use of these rights. This might include requiring users to provide a justification for modifying or deleting logs, requiring multiple approvals before such actions can be taken, and implementing strict auditing and monitoring to detect any inappropriate use of these rights.</p><p>This risk assessment should also consider that a same user could have several roles which gives him different right and duties.</p>",

These assets include the physical and virtual objects required for the information security of the cloud service during the creation, processing, storage, transmission, deletion or destruction of the information in the CSP&rsquo;s area of responsibility, e.g., firewalls, load balancers, web servers, application servers and database servers.</p><p>Asset management shall support the rollout of updates and patches. It also shall monitor that only authorized resources are provided access, and that unauthorized and unmanaged resources are identified and removed and where appropriate, determining which components are affected by new security issues.</p><p>An inventory of these Software and Hardware assets shall be maintained through automatic means to guarantee that all are up to date. Automation is preferable over a manual process due to efficiency and cost reasons.</p><p>Monitoring the process performing the inventory of Software assets means that:</p><ul><li>Assets are tagged.</li><li>All software on the network is actively managed, which means, all software is inventoried, tracked, and corrected, so that only authorized software is installed and executed. Unauthorized and unmanaged software shall be therefore &lsquo;found&rsquo; and prevented from being installed or executed.</li><li>Software inventory tools are used throughout the whole organization and more specifically for the service under certification. These tools allow to keep a catalogue of all software, applications, patches, and versions functioning in the service or resource, as well as to keep track of the changes in the software, resource, or the network. It also allows to manage the licenses of the software assets installed on the service. Furthermore, they also aid in the documentation management.</li><li>Application whitelisting technology is used to ensure that only authorized software is executed, and that all unauthorized software is blocked from being executed on the service&rsquo;s assets.</li></ul><p>Monitoring the process performing the inventory of Hardware assets means:</p><ul><li>To manage actively all hardware devices. This means to inventory, track and correct them so that only authorized devices are provided access, while unauthorized and unmanaged devices are found and prevented from gaining access.</li><li>To use an active discovery tool in order to identify devices that are connected and update the hardware asset inventory accordingly.</li><li>To maintain an up-to-date and accurate inventory of assets that have the potential to store or process information.</li></ul><p>In order to perform automated monitoring of the process performing the inventory of assets the following practices are often considered:</p><ul><li>Make an inventory of all the assets within the cloud service, such as the software, the network interfaces, etc. Large CSPs allow the retrieval of the Cloud inventory with services such as the Azure Resource Graph<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a> or AWS Config.</li><li>Ensure that all the appropriate permissions in the tenant are granted. Role-based Access control is an appropriate method for this as it allows segregation of duties.</li><li>Tag the assets and organize them so they can be accessible by different groups of users, also, if applicable, with different policies. For each asset, record its identification data, function, model and version and location.</li><li>Review the inventory on a regular basis to ensure that unauthorized resources are deleted.</li><li>Log at least all changes to the information related to risk management</li><li>Also, query regularly the assets and resources to make sure that they are present in the approved service.</li><li>Ensure appropriate (read) permissions in the tenant.</li><li>Automate the collection of information about all software on resources. Examples: software name, version, publisher, refresh time, install date and other information.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/resource-graph/first-query-portal\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/resource-graph/first-query-portal</a></p>",

It's important for CSPs to be capable of automatically monitoring identified discrepancies to resolve them as soon as possible in order to minimize among others any negative impacts on the CSP&rsquo;s service provision. This automated monitoring may also lead to the identification of nonconformities, which may need to be reported to the CAB as part of the CSP&rsquo;s continuous monitoring obligations.</p><p>As in the case of PM-04.7H, the deployment of a CSPM service can implement (at least partially) this PM-04.8H requirement. The vast majority of CSPMs implement some sort of notification mechanism to make responsible stakeholders aware of detected violations and discrepancies. CSPs should also look for CSPM features allowing ITS integration, which can greatly expand the notification/reporting capabilities of out-of-the-box CSPMs. This (automated) monitoring may also lead to the identification of nonconformities, which may need to be reported to the CAB as part of the CSP&rsquo;s continuous monitoring obligations.</p><p>Challenges related to the implementation of PM-04.8H can be expected due to the heterogeneity of CSP&rsquo;s implementations/platforms, where no single CSPM/ITS might be able to integrate all expected notifications/interoperability features. In analogy to PM-04.7H, CSPs are expected to rely on multiple technologies/products to integrate in their own IT systems for guaranteeing that related notifications are managed in accordance with EUCS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
