Based on the results obtained, models may need to be adjusted and retrained with different configurations (e.g. with different architectures, parameter settings or feature engineering).\nThe trained models are validated on independent validation data (c.f.

In addition, the training process includes safeguards to ensure the absence of bias with regards to BI-01.\nEspecially, trade-offs between performance, bias mitigation according to BI-03 and hardening according to SR-02 are considered when selecting a model.

For tasks, where neural networks evidently outperform other methods, three networks with different weights should be trained at the beginning. The AI service provider should use cross validation or grid search to tune the hyperparameters. Backtesting should be applied in case of timeseries data.\nEvaluating and addressing overfitting:\n. One indicator for overfitting can be a significantly better performance on training than on test data. Measuring feature importance can also provide insights. This can be done by applying saliency maps or tree interpreters.\n. To overcome overfitting one can potentially use regularization, simpler models or fewer features. For deep learning the options of adding dropout and early stopping can be used. In addition, the number of free parameters in the model (i.e. the weights in a neural network) should be at least 5 times smaller than the number of training examples.\nEvaluating and addressing underfitting:\n. A bad performance on both training and test set can be an indication for underfitting or for not including appropriate features.\n. To overcome underfitting, one can add more complexity to the model e.g. increase the number of free parameters or chose a different model concept.",

The functionality of UPS and NEA is checked at least annually by suitable tests and exercises (cf. BCM-04 - Verification, updating and testing of business continuity).\nc) Maintenance (servicing, inspection, repair) of the utilities in accordance with the manufacturer´s recommendations.\nd) Protection of power supply and telecommunications lines against interruption, interference, damage and eavesdropping. The protection is checked regularly, but at least every two years, as well as in case of suspected manipulation by qualified personnel regarding the following aspects:\n. Traces of violent attempts to open closed distributors;\n. Up-to-datedness of the documentation in the distribution list;\n. Conformity of the actual wiring and patching with the documentation;\n.

Completeness: Missing values should be replaced in an appropriate manner. This depends highly on the feature itself. Special care should be taken when dropping missing values since this can lead to a serious imbalance in the training data;\n. Relevance: Extensive data exploration should help to derive underlying relationships and to determine relevant features to predict another feature;\n.

The countermeasures are tested adequately for effectiveness regarding identified threat models as specified in SR-02 and SR-03.\nThis includes prioritization and implementation of adequate proactive and reactive measures for both learning pipeline and model robustness depending on their feasibility and criticality.\nThe implemented countermeasures must be tested by subject matter experts not involved in their design and implementation. In order to assess the effectiveness of the countermeasures, adaptive attacks are performed.\nThe countermeasures are documented according to PC-02.\nThe suitability of implemented countermeasures as well as residual risks must be formally accepted by the risk owner. In case the risk owner does not accept the remaining level of risk, SR-07 must be considered.\nDepending on the results of the sensitivity analysis performed in SR-04, the AI service provider must implement measures in order to limit the impact of data that users can contribute such that the functionality of the AI service stays intact while attack capabilities are reduced.",

Following examples of countermeasures can be considered:\nAdversarial defenses:\n. Reactive defenses act on the input before it reaches the AI model(s) within the scope of the AI service:\n- Detection of adversarial examples;\n- Input transformation as a preprocessing step (e.g. filters).\n. Proactive defenses aim at building inherently robust models:\n- Adversarial training;\n- Provable defenses;\n- Robust deep architectures (distillation);\n- Defenses based on generative adversarial networks (GAN).\nData poisoning defenses:\n. Data sanitization;\n. Anomaly detection;\n. Golden dataset;\n. Bounded Norm Defense.\nPrivacy measures:\nCountermeasures to privacy attacks should be considered. An example could be the use of privacy preserving machine learning techniques (e.g. differential privacy, federated learning).",
