Cisco.csv,Cisco Cloud Controls Framework (CCF) Public Release V2.0+++,https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/compliance/ccf.html#~standards-mapped,"This file is the Cisco Cloud Controls Framework (CCF).

It is a Unified Control Framework mapping matrix. It defines a set of internal master controls (labeled CCF 1, CCF 2, etc.) and maps each one to equivalent requirements in numerous global standards, including ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST, BSI C5, and EUCS.

It acts as a ""translation layer"" to help organizations manage compliance with multiple standards simultaneously using a single set of controls.",Controls,"SOC TSC Common Criteria

MEDINA_EUCS_MetricsMapping_Clean.csv,?,?,"Last version of controls mapped sended by Iñaki via mail. This file is a control mapping matrix. It maps metrics to EUCS (European Union Cybersecurity Scheme) to their equivalent controls in other standards, specifically Germany's BSI C5, France's SecNumCloud, ISO 27002, and ISO 27017. The new associations focus on linking EUCS controls to updated schemes (SecNumCloud, ISO 27002, ISO 27017), whereas the old version linked EUCS only to BSIC5. In training we will use the same controls as before but with the new associations; the old ones will remain only in the test set. We only have SecNumCloud among the new schemes because the ISO standards are copyrighted. Importantly, these links connect EUCS to other schemes, but they do not imply relationships between the other schemes themselves.",Controls,"BSI C5: OIS-04
