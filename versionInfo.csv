Cisco.csv,Cisco Cloud Controls Framework (CCF) Public Release V2.0+++,https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/compliance/ccf.html#~standards-mapped,"This file is the Cisco Cloud Controls Framework (CCF).

It is a Unified Control Framework mapping matrix. It defines a set of internal master controls (labeled CCF 1, CCF 2, etc.) and maps each one to equivalent requirements in numerous global standards, including ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST, BSI C5, and EUCS.

It acts as a ""translation layer"" to help organizations manage compliance with multiple standards simultaneously using a single set of controls.",Controls,"SOC TSC Common Criteria
