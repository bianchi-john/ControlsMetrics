IT service providers in clouds (SecnumCloud) - Date Date Version References Dispute Criterion Page Prior to the assessment for qualifying the service, the service provider must have an initial independent information security review by a skilled information systems security audit provider [PASSI]. This initial review must in particular cover6: - for services other than IAAS (CAAS, PAAS, SaaS, etc.), an audit of the configuration of virtual or physical resources, operating systems and basic software (OS, Middleware, Databases, ...) within the perimeter of the service; - an intrusion test on the administration interfaces of the service made available to sponsors; - For a SaaS type service, an intrusion test on the interface made available to end users as well as an audit of the source code relating to the implemented safety functionalities (authentication, sessions management, partitioning in the event of a multi-benefit mode). If the SaaS renders an information security service, a dedicated product certification is necessary. In the event of a major change that may affect the service, the service provider must have an independent change review by a qualified information system security audit provider. This independent change review must in particular cover the following audit activities: - Architecture audit; - Organizational and physical audit; - audit of the configuration of the technical service infrastructure; - an intrusion test on the administration interfaces of the service made available to sponsors; - For a SaaS type service, an intrusion test on the interface provision of end users as part of the service catalog, as well as an audit of the source code relating to the implemented security features (authentication, sessions management, partitioning of partitions in the event of a multi-tenant mode). If the SaaS renders an information security service, a dedicated product certification is necessary.",18.2
